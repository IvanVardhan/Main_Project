Alzheimer's Disease Prediction.
This is our project during our Final Semester where we implemented the research paper https://jeas.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s44147-023-00211-x using MRI dataset called OASIS which contains numerous MRI scans of brain images seperated into four classes namely VeryMildDemented, MildDemented, ModerateDemented and NonDemented. we preprocessed those images by rescaling them to 196*196 pixels and applied OTSu segmentation which seperates foreground and background. And then we given those images to a CNN Architecture to classify them for early diagnosis. And we got an F1 score of 0.94. The dataset for this project made available through online dataset portals like kaggle etc.
